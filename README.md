# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Back-end project

[Backend repository](https://github.com/Dicoly/P9-front-end-dashboard)

This repo contains all the source code to run the micro API for the sports analytics dashboard.

## 2. Project (**without Docker**)

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 2.2 Launching the project

- Fork the backend repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- The `yarn` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `yarn dev` command will allow you to run the micro API.

## 3. Endpoints

### 3.1 Possible endpoints

This project includes four endpoints that you will be able to use: 

- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}` - retrieves information from a user. This first endpoint includes the user id, user information (first name, last name and age), the current day's score (todayScore) and key data (calorie, macronutrient, etc.).
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day. The week starts on Monday.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).


**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

## Libraries

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Free API resquest library.
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) - Free chart library.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
